    <string name="about_dialog"><![CDATA[This application was created for a JP Morgan & Chase code assessment. It incorporates all of the tried and true Mine Sweeper game play that you have grown to love, with a new, polished, material design look. I made the decision to go with a consistent 9 column layout for the game board regardless of the game board difficulty chosen. This is not how the typical game is presented, but I felt this allowed much easier mobile oriented/one handed game play which adds to the experience. I hope you enjoy my version of this classic. Please leave some feedback on Google Play. Thanks!]]></string>
